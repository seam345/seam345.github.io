AboutMeNotes

Having had a passion for computers and software from the age of 11, then later specifying the spec building and upgrading my own computer, I have just compleated a University degree in computer science achieving a 2:1. 
I have managed to complete my degree following 2 years at college and 3 years at University following a gap year chasing my passion for travel mountain, biking and snowboarding in Canada.
During my first year in University, I started developing mobile apps and more advanced coding further enhancing my portfolio and knowledge base, this has allowed me to promote my skills to the market and soon put myself in a position of employment on a self-employed freelance basis 
My first break came with the HandsFree Group developing apps for their clients in the delivery and courier industry this has given me an understanding of delivering projects in a timely precise manner
