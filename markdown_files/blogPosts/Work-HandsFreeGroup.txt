Work: Handsfree group

Earlier this year I worked on a defect-reporting app for Handsfree. There was no access to their source code, so I had to start from scratch: I used Ionic as my development platform to allow for easy deployment to all other platforms. Working on this project was a great opportunity to improve my skills in Javascript, Typescript, CSS and HTML.
