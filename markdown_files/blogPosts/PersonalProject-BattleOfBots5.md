# Personal Project: Battle Of Bots #5

In July 2016, I took part in a 7-day competition to create a program that would compete 
against other peopleâ€™s in a game called [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) (Othello).
I wrote my programme in Java, using the programming platform 
[Hackerearth](https://www.hackerearth.com).
